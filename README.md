Modal Window
This repository contains files for a modal window component. The modal window is used to display a captcha verification prompt to confirm that the user is not a robot.

Files
The repository contains the following files:

index.html: The main HTML file that defines the structure and content of the webpage.
style.css: The CSS file that contains the styling for the webpage.
script.js: The JavaScript file that contains the functionality for the modal window.
Usage
To use the modal window component, follow these steps:

Include the index.html, style.css, and script.js files in your project.

Add the following HTML code to your webpage where you want to display the modal window:

html
Copy code
<div id="modal" class="modal-overlay">
  <div class="modal-content">
    <h2>Enter the displayed number to verify that you are not a robot</h2>
    <div id="captchaContainer"></div>
    <input type="text" id="captchaInput" placeholder="Enter the CAPTCHA value" />
    <button id="verifyBtn">Verify</button>
  </div>
</div>
Customize the modal window content as needed. You can modify the heading, input field, and button to fit your requirements.

Customize the modal window styling by modifying the style.css file. You can change colors, fonts, sizes, and other visual properties to match your website's design.

Customize the modal window functionality by modifying the script.js file. You can add event listeners, validation logic, and other JavaScript code to handle user interactions with the modal window.

Test the modal window by opening your webpage and triggering the modal window display according to your implementation.

The modal window component is based on the modal window tutorial by Example Author.

The provided code implements a simple modal window using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. A modal is like a popup window that appears on top of the webpage content, usually to capture user input or display additional information without navigating to a new page.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:

HTML: The HTML part defines the modal and its related components.

The outermost <div> with the ID "modal" represents the entire modal dialog. It is initially hidden from view, thanks to the CSS "display: none" property.
The next <div> with the ID "modal-content" is the modal's main content area, where information or input fields can be placed.
The modal also contains a close button (an element with the class "close-button") represented by a simple Unicode "×" symbol. This button allows the user to close the modal when clicked.
CSS: The CSS part provides the modal's appearance.

The "#modal" selector sets the modal's dimensions and centers it on the screen with absolute positioning and margin.
The "#modal-content" selector styles the main content area with padding.
The ".close-button" selector styles the close button, giving it a red color, and it will turn white when the user hovers over it.
JavaScript: The JavaScript part adds functionality to the modal.

When the "Open Modal" button is clicked (identified by the "modal-button" ID), the toggleModal() function is triggered.
The toggleModal() function first selects the modal's outermost <div> element by its ID ("modal").
It then toggles the "hidden" class on this element, which uses the "display: none" property to hide or show the modal. This action makes the modal visible when the button is clicked and hides it when the close button is clicked.
Additionally, the function stopScrolling() is called to prevent scrolling of the background content when the modal is open. This function sets the body's overflow to hidden, ensuring the background content stays fixed while the modal is open.
The function stopScrolling() also adds a listener to the close button to call the toggleModal() function when the user clicks on it, effectively closing the modal.
That's the complete functionality of the modal window in the provided code. When the "Open Modal" button is clicked, the modal dialog is displayed, and when the close button (the "×" symbol) or the background outside the modal is clicked, the modal is hidden again.
